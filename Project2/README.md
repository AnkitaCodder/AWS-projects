# Secure Healthcare Report Delivery using AWS SNS

## Industry
Healthcare

---

## Problem Statement
Patient medical records are sensitive and need to be shared **securely and privately**.  
The challenge is to **send patient reports online** in a way that only the **intended recipient** can access them.

---

## Project Description
In this project, I worked on a **hospital use case** where patient reports are sent online using **AWS SNS**.

The application is hosted on an **EC2 instance inside an Amazon VPC**.  
Patient reports are published **privately** using Amazon SNS, and patients receive **mobile push notifications** to access their reports securely.

This approach improves **privacy, security, and reliable message delivery**.
