Hi, Everyone,
I deployed a simple PHP website with a MySQL database on AWS, ensuring high availability and scalability.

Steps I implemented:
 1. Launched EC2 instances to host the PHP website
 2. Enabled Auto Scaling (min 2 instances) for high availability
 3. Created an Amazon RDS MySQL instance for database management
 4. Configured Database & Table.
 5. Updated website configuration to connect with RDS
 6. Managed security groups to allow EC2 ↔ RDS communication
 7. Allowed secure traffic access to the application

What I learned while doing this project:
1. Launched an EC2 and network settings.
2. Auto Scaling Groups.
4. Creating and Managing RDS MySQL.
5. Security groups for communication with the services.
Lastly, I am attaching some screenshots you can go to the capstone project.docx and download it in the repo.
