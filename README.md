# AWS PHP Website with MySQL (RDS)

Hi Everyone 👋  

I deployed a simple **PHP website with a MySQL database on AWS**, focusing on **high availability and scalability**.

---

## Project Description
In this project, I hosted a PHP-based web application on **EC2 instances** and connected it to an **Amazon RDS MySQL database**.  
To ensure high availability, I configured an **Auto Scaling Group** with a minimum of **two EC2 instances**.

## Steps I Implemented

1. Launched EC2 instances to host the PHP website  
2. Enabled Auto Scaling (minimum 2 instances) for high availability  
3. Created an Amazon RDS MySQL instance for database management  
4. Created and configured the database and tables  
5. Updated the website configuration to connect with RDS  
6. Managed security groups to allow communication between EC2 and RDS  
7. Allowed secure traffic access to the application
